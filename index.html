        <h3 align="center">My goals</h3>
        <p align="center" width="200">My goals of this website will be to track my progress as I become <br>
            a better computer scientist. See, I have this vision of myself, <br>
            and have for some time, that I am obsessed with learning. So this <br>
            will be a constantly developing website of every skill I come across <br>
            through blogs and implemented or downloadable programs, softwares, <br>
            and content to hopefully stimulate your want to push for something <br>
            you may have been pushing off. <br>
            <br>
            ... just remember it's never too late.
